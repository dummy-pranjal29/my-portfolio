        <p className="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          I’m a software developer who enjoys turning complex ideas into clean,
          reliable, and scalable systems. I’ve worked across full-stack and
          backend development, building modern web platforms with Next.js and
          React, designing RESTful APIs, and using Python for data processing,
          automation, and machine-learning workflows. I like understanding how
          systems behave under the hood and improving them with clarity,
          performance, and purpose. Outside of work, I enjoy travelling and
          exploring new places, listening to music, watching films, and spending
          time in the mountains. I’m also drawn to strategy-driven games like
          cricket and chess, which keep me sharp, patient, and thoughtful in how
          I approach problems.
